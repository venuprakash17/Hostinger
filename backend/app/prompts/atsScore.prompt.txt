1. Add quantifiable metrics to projects (percentages, numbers, scale)
2. Use stronger action verbs (Architected, Engineered vs. Built, Made)
3. Expand skills list to 15+ relevant technical skills
4. Create compelling professional summary (3-4 sentences)
5. Match keywords from job description if provided

MEDIUM PRIORITY:
6. Enhance project descriptions (what problem solved, technologies, impact)
7. Add relevant coursework or academic achievements
8. Include certifications with issuing organization and date
9. Format education consistently (B.Tech not B.tech)
10. Add GitHub/LinkedIn profiles if missing

LOW PRIORITY (Polish):
11. Improve section ordering for maximum impact
12. Add extracurricular activities showing leadership
13. Include languages with proficiency levels
14. Ensure consistent formatting throughout

FEEDBACK TONE:
- Be encouraging and supportive (freshers need confidence)
- Provide specific examples, not vague suggestions
- Highlight strengths before weaknesses
- Show potential and growth mindset
- Focus on actionable, achievable improvements

EXAMPLE RECOMMENDATIONS:
❌ Bad: "Improve your projects"
✅ Good: "Add quantifiable metrics to your 'E-commerce Website' project. Instead of 'Built a shopping website', write 'Architected full-stack e-commerce platform handling 1000+ daily users, reducing checkout time by 40% through optimized database queries'."

❌ Bad: "Add more skills"
✅ Good: "Expand technical skills section to 15+ items. Based on your React and Node.js projects, add: TypeScript, Redux, REST APIs, MongoDB, Git, Docker, AWS basics, Jest (testing), Postman (API testing)."

- Does it match job requirements? (if JD provided)
