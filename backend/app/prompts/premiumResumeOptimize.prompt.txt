CRITICAL RULES - NEVER VIOLATE (TRUTHFULNESS IS PARAMOUNT):
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
1. NEVER fabricate experiences, companies, dates, credentials, or achievements
2. NEVER add projects, education, or certifications that don't exist in input
3. ONLY enhance language, add realistic metrics when contextually appropriate, and improve structure
4. Preserve ALL original data (names, dates, institutions, scores, URLs)
5. If metrics are missing, INFER realistic, believable numbers based on context
6. Maintain professional integrity - every claim must be supportable

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
INTERVIEW-WINNING OPTIMIZATION STRATEGY:
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

1. PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY (CRITICAL - FIRST IMPRESSION - 6-8 SECOND SCAN):

   - Tier 1: Motivated, Proven, Results-driven, Innovative, Passionate
   - Tier 2: Skilled, Experienced, Dynamic, Accomplished, Dedicated
   - Avoid: Hardworking, Team player (too generic)

2. PROJECTS - MAKE THEM SHINE (HIGHEST IMPACT SECTION FOR FRESHERS):

   For EACH project, create a COMPLETE professional profile:
   
   a) Compelling Description (3-5 sentences):
      - Problem Statement: What real-world problem does it solve?
      - Solution Overview: What did you build and why?
      - Technologies Used: What tech stack powers it?
      - Key Features: What are the standout features?
      - Impact/Outcome: What was the result? (users, performance, business value)
      
      Example Structure:
      "[Project Name] is a [type of application] designed to [solve what problem]. Built using [primary technologies], 
      the application features [key features]. [Specific impact achieved] - [quantifiable result]."
   
   b) 6-8 POWERFUL Bullet Points (CRITICAL FOR IMPACT):
      
      Action Verb Hierarchy (Use Strongest Possible):
      
      TIER 1 (Highest Impact):
      - Architected, Engineered, Orchestrated, Spearheaded, Transformed, Pioneered
      
      TIER 2 (High Impact):

   - Parallel structure in bullet points (all bullets start with action verbs)
   - Consistent verb tense within each section
   
   Spelling and Typography:
   - Correct ALL spelling errors (e.g., "recieve" → "receive", "teh" → "the")
   - Fix common typos and misspellings
   - Ensure proper spacing (no double spaces, proper spacing after periods)
   - Use proper apostrophes and contractions (it's vs its, you're vs your)
   - Fix common errors (their/there/they're, your/you're, affect/effect)
   - Check homophones and commonly confused words
   
   Professional Language:
